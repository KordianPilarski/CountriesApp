# Countries App

The application was developed utilizing the React Native CLI, providing users the opportunity to expand their knowledge on various countries. The app offers a user-friendly interface, allowing users to create an account, access country information in the "Countries" tab, and test their knowledge through a quiz in the "Quiz" tab. Data about countries is gathered from external API. The quiz results can be viewed in the "User" tab. The app has been integrated with firebase to include login, sign-up, and authentication functionality.

Given additional time, I would aim to incorporate the use of Typescript, implement the storage of users' quiz results in a database, and enhance the overall functionality of the quiz feature.
